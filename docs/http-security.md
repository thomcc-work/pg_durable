## 1. Feature Flags

Outbound HTTP access is controlled entirely by Cargo features at build time.
The database cannot override these choices — they cannot be changed with GUCs
or SQL.

| Feature | What is allowed | Use case |
|---------|-----------------|----------|
| *(none)* | Nothing — `df.http()` errors immediately at DSL time **and** at execution time | Deployments that don't need HTTP |
| `http-allow-azure-domains` | HTTPS to subdomains of the Azure allow-list plus `api.github.com`; bare IPs blocked; redirects blocked | Production |
| `http-allow-test-domains` | HTTPS to everything in `http-allow-azure-domains` **plus** `httpbingo.org` | E2E testing; implies `http-allow-azure-domains` |
| `http-allow-all` | HTTP and HTTPS to all URLs; SSRF IP blocklist and allow-list are both disabled | Local development only |

The scripts and CI use `http-allow-test-domains` so that the HTTP E2E tests
pass — this includes the source-built `Dockerfile` used for local dev and CI.
The released Debian packages are built with `http-allow-azure-domains`, so the
published Docker image (`Dockerfile.release`, which installs that package)
inherits the `http-allow-azure-domains` policy.

### When no feature is set

`df.http()` **fails at the point `df.http()` is called in SQL** with:

```
df.http() is disabled. Rebuild with the 'http-allow-azure-domains' Cargo feature to enable outbound HTTP requests.
```

Because `df.nodes` rows can be inserted by hand (bypassing the DSL), the same
block is enforced again at execution time inside `execute_http.rs` via
`validate_allowlist`.

```

All three layers run inside `execute_http.rs` before the request is sent.
There is no GUC, no table override, no superuser bypass for Layers 1 and 2.

## 3. Layer 0: PostgreSQL Privilege Check

### 3.1 Purpose

A user granted `df.grant_usage()` can call `df.start()` directly with a
hand-crafted `Durofut` JSON string, inserting an HTTP node without ever calling
`df.http()`.  The DSL-time guard inside `df.http()` does not run in that path.

To close this gap, `execute_http` checks at execution time whether the
`submitted_by` role recorded in the node still holds `EXECUTE` privilege on
`df.http()`.  If the role's grant has been revoked since the node was created,
the node fails immediately.

### 3.2 Mechanism

`execute_http` runs the following check before any network activity:

```sql
SELECT CASE
           WHEN p.oid IS NULL THEN 'absent'
           WHEN has_function_privilege($submitted_by::regrole, p.oid, 'EXECUTE') THEN 'allowed'
           ELSE 'denied'
       END
FROM (SELECT COALESCE(
    to_regprocedure('df.http(text,text,text,jsonb,integer,jsonb)'),
    to_regprocedure('df.http(text,text,text,jsonb,integer)')
) AS oid) p
```

The signature is resolved with `to_regprocedure()` over an ordered list — the
current form first, the pre-0.2.8 form second — because a `::regprocedure` cast
raises on a missing function, and the same binary must run against older
installed schemas that only have the five-argument form. Only `'allowed'`
permits the request; `'absent'` (neither signature installed) and `'denied'`
both fail the node.

`has_function_privilege` honours PostgreSQL's standard privilege model:
superusers always return `true`; regular roles return `true` only when an
explicit `GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION df.http(text, text, text, jsonb, integer, jsonb) TO <role>` (or a role that
inherits one) is in effect.

### 3.3 Managing access

HTTP access is **opt-in** and separate from general `df` access.

#### Granting access

Use `df.grant_usage()` with `include_http => true`:

```sql
SELECT df.grant_usage('my_role', include_http => true);
```

Or grant directly:

```sql
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION df.http(text, text, text, jsonb, integer) TO my_role;
```

`df.grant_usage('my_role')` (without `include_http`) grants all standard `df`
privileges but **not** `df.http()`.  HTTP access must be explicitly opted in to.

#### Revoking access

To remove HTTP access without removing all `df` access:

```sql
REVOKE EXECUTE ON FUNCTION df.http(text, text, text, jsonb, integer) FROM my_role;
```

After this, any existing or future HTTP nodes submitted by `my_role` will fail
at execution time with a "permission denied" error.  All other `df` functions
remain accessible.

`df.revoke_usage('my_role')` removes all `df` access, including `df.http()`.

#### PUBLIC grant and upgrades

Fresh installs (v0.2.0+) have `EXECUTE` on `df.http()` revoked from `PUBLIC`
at `CREATE EXTENSION` time.  Installs that upgraded from v0.1.1 **retain** the
PUBLIC grant that v0.1.1 issued — the upgrade script does not revoke it.

If an upgraded install should enforce opt-in HTTP permissions, the admin must
run manually:

```sql
REVOKE EXECUTE ON FUNCTION df.http(text, text, text, jsonb, integer) FROM PUBLIC;
```

When `df.grant_usage(role, include_http => false)` is called and the role still
has effective HTTP access via the PUBLIC grant (or another inherited grant),
that grant is left intact — `df.grant_usage()` is purely additive and never
issues a `REVOKE`. Call `df.revoke_usage()` first to downgrade a role.

### 3.4 Admin function protection

`df.grant_usage()` and `df.revoke_usage()` are admin-only functions.
`EXECUTE` is revoked from `PUBLIC` at `CREATE EXTENSION` time, so only
superusers can call them — plus any role an admin delegated to with
`df.grant_usage(role, with_grant => true)`.

`df.grant_usage()` issues a specific set of grants: `USAGE ON SCHEMA df`,
column-scoped table privileges, `EXECUTE` on `df.http()` / `df.http_multipart()`
when `include_http => true`, and `EXECUTE` on `df.grant_usage()`,
`df.revoke_usage()` and `df.metrics()` when `with_grant => true`. Those five
functions are the only ones with `PUBLIC` `EXECUTE` revoked at install; every
other `df.*` function keeps PostgreSQL's default, so **schema `USAGE` is the
real access gate**. Granting `USAGE ON SCHEMA df` by hand therefore exposes the
whole DSL surface at once; prefer `df.grant_usage()`.

### 3.5 Feature-flag interaction

The privilege check runs regardless of which HTTP Cargo feature is enabled.
When no HTTP feature is compiled in, the request is still blocked later by the
DSL-time guard and by execution-time URL validation, but the privilege check
remains compiled in and still runs before any network activity.

## 4. Layer 1: IP Blocklist (SSRF protection)

### 4.1 Blocked IPv4 ranges

| CIDR | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `0.0.0.0/8` | "This" network |
| `10.0.0.0/8` | RFC 1918 private |
| `127.0.0.0/8` | Loopback |
| `169.254.0.0/16` | Link-local — includes cloud metadata at `169.254.169.254` |
| `172.16.0.0/12` | RFC 1918 private |
| `192.168.0.0/16` | RFC 1918 private |

### 4.2 Blocked IPv6 ranges

| Range | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `::/128` | Unspecified |
| `::1/128` | Loopback |
| `fe80::/10` | Link-local |
| `fc00::/7` | Unique local (ULA) |

### 4.3 IPv4-mapped IPv6 handling

Addresses of the form `::ffff:A.B.C.D` are unwrapped to their embedded IPv4
before the blocklist check, preventing bypasses like `::ffff:169.254.169.254`.

### 4.4 DNS rebinding prevention

The SSRF-safe DNS resolver (`SsrfSafeResolver`) wraps the system resolver and
filters blocked IPs **inline** — the same IP that passes the check is the one
used for the TCP connection.  There is no window for a rebinding attack.

Restricted builds disable reqwest's system and environment proxy discovery.
An HTTP proxy resolves the destination itself, outside `SsrfSafeResolver`, so
inheriting `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, or platform proxy settings would bypass
the destination-IP check.

Only the single IP address that `reqwest` actually connects to is checked.  If
DNS returns multiple A/AAAA records, the others are not checked because they
are never used.  This is intentional, not a gap — checking unused addresses
would create false positives without any security benefit.

### 4.5 IP literals in URL

Bare IP literals in URLs (e.g. `http://169.254.169.254/...`) bypass DNS
entirely — `reqwest` connects directly without calling the resolver.
`validate_allowlist` blocks all bare IPs unconditionally, so these never
reach the resolver.

---

## 5. Layer 2: Endpoint Allow-List

### 5.1 Azure domains (always present with `http-allow-azure-domains`)

Only subdomains of the following suffixes are permitted.  Apex domains (e.g.
`blob.core.windows.net` without a subdomain label) are rejected.

| Suffix | Service |
|--------|---------|
| `.blob.core.windows.net` | Azure Blob Storage |
| `.blob.storage.azure.net` | Azure Blob Storage (secondary) |
| `.queue.core.windows.net` | Azure Queue Storage |
| `.table.core.windows.net` | Azure Table Storage |
| `.file.core.windows.net` | Azure Files |
| `.azurewebsites.net` | Azure App Service |
| `.azure-api.net` | Azure API Management |
| `.documents.azure.com` | Azure Cosmos DB |
| `.servicebus.windows.net` | Azure Service Bus |
| `.openai.azure.com` | Azure OpenAI |
| `.cognitiveservices.azure.com` | Azure Cognitive Services |
| `.vault.azure.net` | Azure Key Vault |
| `.redis.cache.windows.net` | Azure Cache for Redis |
| `.database.windows.net` | Azure SQL Database |
| `.kusto.windows.net` | Azure Data Explorer |
| `.azurefd.net` | Azure Front Door |
| `.azureedge.net` | Azure CDN |
| `.azure-devices.net` | Azure IoT Hub |
| `.trafficmanager.net` | Azure Traffic Manager |
| `.cloudapp.azure.com` | Azure Cloud App |

### 5.2 Exact-match domains (always present with `http-allow-azure-domains`)

Matched exactly — subdomains and lookalikes are rejected.

| Domain | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `api.github.com` | GitHub API |

### 5.3 Test domains (additional with `http-allow-test-domains`)

| Domain | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `httpbingo.org` | HTTP echo service (used in HTTP E2E tests) |

### 5.4 Bare IP rejection

All bare IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are rejected by `validate_allowlist`
regardless of feature flag — even under `http-allow-azure-domains`.
Because the allowlist blocks all bare IPs, there is no separate IP-literal
check; the allowlist is the definitive gate for IP-literal URLs.

### 5.4 One parse, one URL

The host judged by the allow-list is read from the `url::Url` that is then
handed to `reqwest`, never from the caller's string. Comparing a separately
parsed host against the allow-list would let the two parsers disagree: WHATWG
ends the authority of an `http(s)` URL at `\`, so in
`https://evil.example\@acct.blob.core.windows.net/` the host is
`evil.example` and the allow-listed name is merely path. A scan that read the
name after the last `@` would approve a request aimed elsewhere — and with an
IP literal in that position it would also clear the bare-IP rule, the only
gate for targets that skip DNS.

Judging the parsed host means the allow-list follows canonicalisation as
`reqwest` performs it: percent-encoded host characters are decoded,
non-dotted IPv4 notation (`http://2130706433/`) becomes an IP literal, and
internationalised names are compared in their Punycode form.

---

## 6. Additional Hardening

### 6.1 Scheme restriction

Restricted builds accept only `https://`. This prevents credentials and request
bodies from being transmitted over plaintext connections. Plaintext `http://`
is available only with the development-only `http-allow-all` feature.

All other schemes (`file://`, `ftp://`, `gopher://`, etc.) are rejected before
any DNS resolution or connection attempt. Scheme validation runs both when the
DSL node is created and when the canonical parsed URL is executed.

### 6.2 Redirect blocking

`reqwest` is built with `Policy::none()` (no redirect following).  This
prevents redirect-based bypasses where an attacker hosts a public server that
returns a `302 Location: http://169.254.169.254/...` — since the redirect
target is an IP literal, the DNS resolver would never be called.

---

## 7. Audit Logging

Every HTTP attempt (allowed or blocked) is logged via `ctx.trace_info` with:

- `submitted_by` — the role that called `df.start()` at the time the node was
  created (captured as `current_user` in the DSL and stored in `FunctionNode`)
- `url` — the requested URL, **redacted** (see below)
- Block reason tag — `(scheme)`, `(allowlist)`, or `(ip)` in the log prefix

Resolved IP addresses are **not** included in error messages or logs to avoid
leaking internal network topology to potentially malicious users.

### 7.1 URL redaction

A URL is a credential carrier: an Azure SAS token lives entirely in the query
string, and `?api-key=` / `?code=` are common elsewhere. The server log is a
weaker boundary than the database — no RLS, no `pg_durable.retention_days`, and
frequently a separate shipping and backup path — so `crate::redact::redact_url`
is applied before any URL reaches a log line or an error string.

| Component | Treatment |
|-----------|-----------|
| Scheme, host, port, path | Preserved. The URL is reparsed, so a logged line may be normalized (host lowercased, default port dropped) relative to what the workflow supplied. |
| Query parameter *names* | Preserved — `sig` and `code` are not themselves secret, and keeping them makes a redacted line diagnosable |
| Query parameter *values* | Replaced with `<redacted>`, except an allowlist of benign parameters (`api-version`, `apiversion`, `comp`, `restype`) |
| Bare query token with no `=` | Replaced whole — indistinguishable from a name |
| `userinfo@` | Replaced with `<redacted>@`, keeping the host |
| Fragment | Replaced whole |
| Unparseable input | Replaced whole — redaction fails closed and never echoes back a string it could not parse |

Parsing uses the `url` crate, so IPv6 authorities, percent-encoding, default
ports and userinfo follow the spec rather than ad-hoc string splitting.

The same redaction is applied to the HTTP client's own error text, which
interpolates the request URL into messages such as
`error sending request for url (...)`. This matters because activity errors are
persisted to `df.nodes.error` and recorded in durable execution history, not
just written to the log.

Request headers and bodies are never logged.

> **Not covered:** the response body. A workflow's final result is traced on
> completion, and the full response envelope is stored in `df.nodes.result`. A
> request whose *response* is a credential — reading a secret from Key Vault, or
> an OAuth token endpoint — still persists that value. Response-side redaction
> is tracked separately.

## 9. Out of Scope

These items are deferred to a future customer-level access control spec:

| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Per-role URL/domain allowlists configurable by admins | GUC or table-driven |
| Rate limiting | DoS mitigation, not SSRF |
| Response size limits | Resource management |
| Port restrictions | Low value at this layer |
| Egress filtering to attacker-controlled domains | Separate threat (T9) |
| **Azure Private Endpoint** | Private Endpoints assign private RFC 1918 addresses to Azure services, which the IP blocklist currently blocks. Supporting Private Endpoints requires a targeted exemption mechanism that does not open all private ranges. Design is deferred to a future spec. |
